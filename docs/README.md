Scorecard-Bundle is a **high-level Scorecard modeling API** that is easy-to-use and **Scikit-Learn consistent**.  It covers the major steps to train a Scorecard model such as feature discretization with ChiMerge, WOE encoding, feature evaluation with information value and collinearity, Logistic-Regression-based Scorecard model, and model evaluation for binary classification tasks. All the transformer and model classes in Scorecard-Bundle comply with Scikit-Learn‘s fit-transform-predict convention.
